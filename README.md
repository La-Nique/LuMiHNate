###### **Instagram (reference)**
######    - **Category:** Photo & Video / Social 
######    - **Mobile:** Website is view only, uses camera, mobile first experience.
######    - **Story:** Allows users to share their lives in pictures and enhance their content with filters
######    - **Market:** Anyone that takes pictures could enjoy this app. Ability to follow and hashtag based on interests and categories allows users with unique interests to engage with relevant content.
######    - **Habit:** Users can post throughout the day many times. Features like "Stories" encourage more candid posting as well. Users can explore endless pictures in any category imaginable whenever they want. Very habbit forming!
######    - **Scope:** Instagram started out extremely narrow focused, just posting pics and viewing feeds. Has expanded to a somewhat larger scope including "Instagram Stories" (a la SnapChat) and messenger features.
